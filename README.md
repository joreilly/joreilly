### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Galway, Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª and working for [Neat](https://twitter.com/neat_no) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´

## Some more background
- Working professionally as hands-on software engineer for 30 years (and as hobby for about 6 years before that!).  
- Developing for Android since 2010 (using Kotlin for last 3 years).
- Keenly interested in Kotlin Multiplatform and, in particular, when combined with use of Declarative UI frameworks like Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI! Have given a number of talks and written various articles on the topic over last 2 years ([johnoreilly.dev](johnoreilly.dev)). Have also created a number of related samples/templates. One of these, PeopleInSpace, was included in Kotlin KMM docs.
