### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Galway, Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª and working remotely for Kraken Technology. Google Developer Expert for Kotlin.

## Some more background
- Extensive experience working as a hands-on software engineer on mobile, desktop, server and embedded applicaitons.
- Developing for Android since 2010 (using Kotlin since 2017).
- Keenly interested in Kotlin Multiplatform and, in particular, when combined with use of Declarative UI frameworks like Compose and SwiftUI! Have given talks and written various articles on the topic over the last 5 years ([johnoreilly.dev](http://johnoreilly.dev)). Have also created a number of related samples/templates. Two of these, PeopleInSpace and Confetti, are included in the official Kotlin KMP docs and, along with a number of the others, in the Google Dev Library. Several of the samples are also referenced in the docs of the libraries that they showcase.
- Gets things done!
