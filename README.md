### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Galway, Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª and working for [Neat](https://twitter.com/neat_no) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´. Google Develoer Expert for Kotlin.

## Some more background
- Working professionally as hands-on software engineer for 30+ years (and as hobby for about 6 years before that!).  
- Developing for Android since 2010 (using Kotlin for last 5 years).
- Keenly interested in Kotlin Multiplatform and, in particular, when combined with use of Declarative UI frameworks like Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI! Have given a number of talks and written various articles on the topic over last 3 years ([johnoreilly.dev](http://johnoreilly.dev)). Have also created a number of related samples/templates. One of these, PeopleInSpace, is included in the official Kotlin KMM docs and also the Google Dev Library. A number of the other Kotlin Multiplatform samples are referenced in the docs of the libraries that they showcase.
